## Gridwatch

# Background

In a world increasingly reliant on constant connectivity, the search for real-time solutions to critical issues has become paramount. The quest to develop a comprehensive system for power outage notifications proved both challenging and enlightening.

Frustrated by the lack of readily available APIs offering real-time updates on power outage schedules,I scoured the internet in hopes of finding a solution that would provide the necessary immediacy. The existing options, such as the Eskom Calendar API, fell short as they required periodic queries.

Then, a spark of inspiration struck: why not create a Platform that leverages the power of webhooks to deliver real-time notifications of power outages in the area? And so, GridWatch was born, with an ambitious aim to revolutionize the way people stay informed about electricity disruptions.

#Posibilities

The driving force behind GridWatch was to open up a world of possibilities for developers and users alike. Armed with a real-time webhook integration, the platform unlocks a wealth of potential applications. For starters, it empowers the creation of WhatsApp notification bots that can efficiently dispatch power cut schedules to users' phones, keeping them abreast of any changes as they occur.

But the potential doesn't stop there. GridWatch opens doors to diverse notification systems, from email alerts to push notifications on mobile apps, ensuring that users receive immediate updates wherever they may be. The vision goes even further, imagining a future where industries relying on continuous power can utilize this real-time data to automatically manage their generators, preventing even the slightest disruption in operations
